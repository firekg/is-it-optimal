1. How to run the program?

Run the file **main.py** (The numpy library is required)

2. How to test different models?

The following code in **main.py** allows you to test different hypothesis

```python
task.Set(user_hypo=[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
```

change the [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] to any hypothesis table you want to test. And the result will be printed out in the console.
